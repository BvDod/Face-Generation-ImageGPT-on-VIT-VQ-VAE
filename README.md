# Image Generation: Auto-reggression of VQ-VAE latents (in PyTorch)
This projects aims to be able to generate new realistic looking images by creating models which can auto-regressively predict new latent spaces in a VQ-VAE model. The VQ-VAE can then be used to decode said latent space in a realistic image. 

The VQ-VAE implementation and models used in this project have been created by me under another Github repository (Link)

I will be implementing and comparing a PixelCNN model, and a vision Transformer Model.
